## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication, Note Model and JSON API (1.5 days)


[Details][phase-one]

### Phase 2: Flux Architecture and Note CRUD (2.5 days)


[Details][phase-two]

### Phase 3: Notebooks and Tags (2 days)

Phase 3 adds organization to the Notes. Notes belong to a Notebook, which has
its own `Index` view. Create JSON API for Notebooks. Notes can also now be
tagged with multiple tags. Users can bring up notes in a separate `SearchIndex`
view by searching for their tags. Once the tag search is implemented, I will
extend this to a fuzzy search through every Note's content.

[Details][phase-three]

### Phase 4: Allow Complex Styling in Notes (1 day)

Using the react-quill library (based on Quill.js), allow for complex styling of
notes.

[Details][phase-four]

### Phase 5: Reminders and Garbage Collection (1 day)

Phase 5 introduces two new features. First, users can set reminders on notes
which will at the time they are set for prompt the user to review and edit the
given note. In addition, I will implement a feature that asks users to review
notes once they reach a certain age and ask whether they should be kept,
archived, or deleted.

[Details][phase-five]

### Phase 6: Styling Cleanup and Seeding (1 day)

Bootstrap will have been used to keep things organized up until now, but in
Phase 6 I will add styling flourishes and make modals out of some elements (like
the NotebookForm).

### Bonus Features (TBD)
- [ ] Prettify transitions
- [ ] Use javascript library for cleaner tag selection
- [ ] Changelogs for Notes
- [ ] Pagination / infinite scroll for Notes Index
- [ ] Multiple sessions
